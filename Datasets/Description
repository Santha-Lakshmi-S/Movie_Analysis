Hackathon - Building a Movie Recommendation System

Assume that you started working with Netfiz as a Junior Data Scientist. For your company, providing better movie recommendations is at its core and, helps improve better user experience and generate more revenue. 

Understand that:

Recommender systems make movie-watching a personalized adventure, delighting users with tailored suggestions based on their tastes.
By predicting user preferences, these systems keep users engaged, driving increased interaction with your platform.
A robust movie recommender system translates to business success. Satisfied users are loyal users, contributing to increased user retention and revenue.
Imagine the excitement of helping users discover their next favorite movie! Later during the internship program, we will ask you to create a cutting-edge movie recommendation system based on a treasure trove of user ratings. 

For now, your first task at Netfiz is to crunch the data given and answer all the questions asked below.

About Dataset: Dive into a dataset brimming with 100,836 ratings across 9,742 movies, generated by 610 users over the years. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided about the user. The data are contained in the files `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`and `tags.csv`.

Now that you have a good enough understanding of the given data, apply the "Mandatory Operation" given below before solving any of the following questions.

Mandatory Operations:
1. Group the user ratings based on movieId and apply aggregation operations like count and mean on ratings. 
2. Apply inner join on dataframe created from movies.csv and the grouped df from step 1.
3. Filter only those movies which have more than 50 user ratings (i.e. > 50).

Above steps will make sure that your data contains only those movies which has recieved more than 50 user ratings.


游릭 IMPORTANT NOTE 2 游릭
You already have a subset of data containing only those movies which has recieved more than 50 user ratings.

Using "links.csv", scrape the IMDB reviews of each movie with more than 50 user ratings. "README.md" file contains the required details.
